# Webhook Fanout Service - PRD

## Overview
A Cloudflare Workers service that receives webhooks and fans them out to multiple configured endpoints with intelligent response handling and replay capabilities.

## Problem
- Need to distribute incoming webhooks to multiple systems
- Require primary endpoint response forwarding with fallback logic
- Want comprehensive logging and replay functionality for operational needs

## Solution
Serverless webhook proxy that:
- Receives webhooks and forwards to configured endpoints
- Returns primary endpoint response or 200 OK fallback
- Logs all activity to D1 database
- Provides replay functionality by webhook ID or date range

## Core Features

### 1. Webhook Reception & Fanout
- Accept webhooks on `/webhook` endpoint
- Forward to all configured endpoints with original headers/body
- Primary endpoint response determines webhook response
- Secondary endpoints called asynchronously

### 2. Response Logic
- **Primary Success**: Forward complete primary endpoint response
- **Primary Fail/Missing**: Return 200 OK to webhook sender

### 3. Endpoint Management
- REST API for endpoint CRUD operations
- Single primary endpoint designation
- Custom headers per endpoint
- Dynamic configuration without restarts

### 4. Logging & Observability
- Log all incoming webhooks with metadata
- Log all outgoing requests and responses
- Unique webhook IDs for tracing
- Response time tracking

### 5. Replay Functionality
- Replay specific webhook by ID
- Replay webhooks by date range
- Use current endpoint configuration
- Full logging of replay attempts

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/webhook` | Receive webhooks |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/config/endpoints` | Manage endpoints |
| GET | `/webhooks` | List incoming webhooks |
| GET | `/logs` | View detailed logs |
| POST | `/replay` | Replay webhooks |
| GET | `/init` | Initialize database |

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Workers runtime
- D1 database for persistence
- REST API interface

### Data Storage
- `endpoints` table: endpoint configurations
- `incoming_webhooks` table: webhook summaries
- `webhook_logs` table: detailed request/response logs

### Performance
- Async fanout to secondary endpoints
- Non-blocking primary endpoint response
- Edge deployment for global performance

## Success Metrics
- Webhook delivery success rate > 99.9%
- Primary endpoint response time < 5 seconds
- Replay functionality available within 1 minute of webhook receipt
- Zero infrastructure maintenance overhead

## Out of Scope
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Webhook transformation/filtering
- Complex routing rules
- Multi-tenancy
